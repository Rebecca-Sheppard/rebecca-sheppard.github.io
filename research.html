	<h2> MATH490: Project for MMath (2024 - 25)
  </h2>
  <h3> <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematical-sciences/">University of Liverpool</a> </h3>
  This project expanded on the study of integer circles as introduced in my MATH499
project. I investigated the density of the intersections of integer circles and introduced
the notion of inscribed integer circles of a polygon, which led to a study in the area of
splitting integer angles.
    <h2>LMS Undergraduate Research Project (2024)</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematical-sciences/">University of Liverpool</a>; <a href="https://www.lms.ac.uk/">London Mathematical Society</a></h3>
  In summer 2024, I undertook a summer research project in an area of integer geometry
that was supported by the London Mathematical Society Undergraduate Research
Bursary and the University of Liverpool. This project focused on finding the spectra of
radii of circumscribed circles in integer geometry and led to a research paper.
    <h2>MATH499: Project for MMath (2023-24)</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematical-sciences/">University of Liverpool</a></h3>
  In this project I introduced the notion of a circle in integer geometry and computed the
density of integer circles with respect to an exhaustive sequence of subsets. I explored
the idea of integer n-spheres in higher dimensions and of the intersection of multiple
integer circles.
